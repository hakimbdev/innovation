			<h1>Out-of-School Children Research</h1>
			<p>The number of children missing out on any schooling has increased by six million, 
				bringing the total to 250 million, according to new figures released on Monday by the UN Education, Science,
			    and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

			<h1>GCER International Mission</h1>
			<p>Girl Child Education Watch International is a dedicated non-governmental organization passionately committed to addressing the critical issue of out-of-school children, with a primary emphasis on empowering and educating girls affected by poverty.

				working tirelessly to break down barriers and create pathways to learning for the most vulnerable.
				At the heart of our mission lies the unwavering commitment to ensuring that no girl is left behind due to the shackles of poverty. Girl Child Education Watch International aims to provide underprivileged girls with access to quality education, recognizing it as a powerful catalyst for breaking the cycle of poverty and fostering long-term positive change.
